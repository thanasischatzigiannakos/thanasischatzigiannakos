# Backend Engineer | Cloud Explorer (😶‍🌫️) 

Hey there, I am Athanasios, 

I am stumbling my way across the tech industry working mostly on Backend and saying the word microservices more than I should.

## Things I (should) know

- **Java (Spring Boot)** - 🫘 ☕
- **Python** 🐍 Automating my hopes and dreams
- **GCP** ☁️ 
- **Docker**

## Things I torture myself with on the side

- **Rust** 🦀
- **C/C++** 
- Creating terminal applications that will face ✨ **rm -rf** ✨ before getting a repo
